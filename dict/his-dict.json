  "Clinical pathway refers to the establishment of a set of standardized treatment models and treatment procedures for a certain disease. It is a comprehensive model of clinical treatment, which uses evidence-based medicine and guidelines as a guide to promote treatment organization and disease management methods, and ultimately standardizes medical behavior, reduces variation, reduces costs, and improves quality. Clinical pathway is a standardized diagnosis and treatment procedure that can avoid the traditional pathway that causes different treatment plans for the same disease in different regions, different hospitals, different treatment groups, or different individual physicians, thus avoiding its arbitrariness. Under this procedure, you will receive more standardized and scientific medical services. The following matters regarding clinical pathway disease management are hereby notified:": "临床路径（Clinical pathwa）是指针对某一疾病建立一套标准化治疗模式与治疗程序，是一个有关临床治疗的综合模式，以循证医学证据和指南为指导来促进治疗组织和疾病管理的方法，最终起到规范医疗行为，减少变异，降低成本，提高质量的作用。临床路径是一种标准化的诊疗程序，可以避免传统路径使同一疾病在不同地区、不同医院，不同的治疗组或者不同医师个人间出现不同的治疗方案，避免了其随意性。在这个程序下，您将得到更加规范、科学的医疗服务。现将临床路径病种管理有关事宜告知如下：",
